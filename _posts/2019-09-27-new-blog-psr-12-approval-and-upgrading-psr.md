After a long hiatus, we're back with a new round of updates from the PHP-FIG.

## New Blog

As you may have noticed, **we're now on a different platform**. We've chosen to migrate away from the previous proprietary platform and to **host directly our posts inside our site**, directly under our control. We will add links at the top of all our older posts to the new copies here; if anyone still stumbles upon our posts on the previous platform, they will know where to find us from now on. 

## PSR-12 has been approved

Since the last update, we’ve seen **the approval of PSR-12, the [Extended Coding Style](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)**. This PSR supersedes the old dear PSR-2, adapting it to all the new language features that we've got in the last years, and cleaning up a few inconsistencies. It was a long time coming, since the working group had some troubles along the line, but we finally published it.

You will find that many libraries have already PSR-12 compliant releases, like [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/releases/tag/3.5.0) and [EasyCodingStandard](https://www.tomasvotruba.cz/blog/2018/04/09/try-psr-12-on-your-code-today/), while others are following suit, like [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/issues/4502). 

## Pushing PSR interfaces forward

In the meantime, we're discussing a difficult matter in our mailing list: [how to upgrade PSRs](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/php-fig/OyC3plRYhqg/discussion).

This is an argument that made the round inside the PHP-FIG many times in the past, and still needs a proper solution. Stay tuned to hear more from us on this regard!
