Back in October 2017, Michael Cullum started a new series on the PHP-FIG blog, ‘A month of PHP-FIG’. Unfortunately as things go, the momentum for this didn’t quite get maintained, but fear not, I’m going to do a recap of the comings and goings of the PHP-FIG for the past 3 months.

### **Discussion / PSR Updates**

*   [PSR-12](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/php-fig/J_d85lMDf2k) Entered the review stage at the start of November.
*   [PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/) was unanimously accepted by the core committee and [passed on January 22nd](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/php-fig/f5lL_QNIrgI/SmYZVw_5AwAJ). Woody Gilk, the editor of PSR-15, has created [this blog post](http://shadowhand.me/announcing-psr-15/) and Matthew Weier O’Phinney who was the sponsor created [this post](https://mwop.net/blog/2018-01-23-psr-15.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=phpfig-blog).
*   The end of January seen some more activity for PSR-5 with Chuck Burgess stepping up as editor and requesting members for a new working group with Gary Hockin as core committee sponsor.

### Secretaries

*   November seen both Margaret Staples and Allesandro Lai elected as secretaries to fill 2 vacant slots.
*   In January Michael Cullum’s term expired and I (Mark Railton) was elected to fill that vacancy

### Core Committee

*   Terms for Chris Tankersley, Graham Hoefer, Korvin Szanto & Stefano Torresi all expired. With the exception of Graham, all stood for re-election and Michael Cullum was elected for the 4th position.

### PHP-FIG Website

Thanks to a lot of work from core committee member [Stefano Torresi](https://twitter.com/storresi), the website at [www.php-fig.org](https://www.php-fig.org) has been migrated to a PHP build using [sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) and content has been added for PSR-15 as well as an updated member list.

Going forward, the plan is to keep this blog updated on a monthly basis as a quick overview of what’s going on within PHP-FIG. If you’d like to see more or maybe even get involved, then head over to the [mailing list.](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/php-fig)

Thanks,

PHP-FIG Secretaries.
